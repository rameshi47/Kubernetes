Container images allow us to confine the application code, its runtime, and all of its dependencies in a pre-defined format. The container runtimes like runC, containerd, or cri-o can use pre-packaged images as a source to create and run one or more containers. These runtimes are capable of running containers on a single host, however, in practice, we would like to have a fault-tolerant and scalable solution, achieved by building a single controller/management unit, a collection of multiple hosts connected together. This controller/management unit is generally referred to as a container orchestrator.

In this chapter, we will explore why we should use container orchestrators, different implementations of container orchestrators, and where to deploy them.
